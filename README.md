SlickTiled
==========

The culmination of the 2014 Cambridge Christmas Hackathon.

Built in under 3 hours with a team of 5 people who'd never used Slick2D before. For most people on the team this was their first time using Git and doing from-scratch programming, so it was good fun to discuss plans and implement the game with such a diverse range of experience in the group.

The whole git repo was set up as an IntelliJ project to allow people to clone then open the repo with all of the libs and natives correctly configured so they could get programming immediately. Note: the git repo with the basic Slick2D setup was created and open-sourced in advance of the hackathon so that it didn't take too long to get the whole team set up with the Slick2D libs. We had no idea what the game had to consist of before the hackathon, so all game-specific code was written during the 3 hours in the hackathon.
