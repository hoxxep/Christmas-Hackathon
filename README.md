SlickTiled
==========

The culmination of the 2014 Cambridge Christmas Hackathon.

Built with a team of 5 people who'd never used Slick2D before in under 3 hours. For most people on the team this was their first time using Git and doing from-scratch programming, so it was good fun to discuss plans and implement the game with the diverse range of experience in the group.
