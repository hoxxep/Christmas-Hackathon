SlickTiled
==========

The culmination of the 2014 Cambridge Christmas Hackathon.

Built in under 3 hours with a team of 5 people who'd never used Slick2D before. For most people on the team this was their first time using Git and doing from-scratch programming, so it was good fun to discuss plans and implement the game with such a diverse range of experience in the group.

The whole git repo was set up as an IntelliJ project to allow people to clone then open the repo with all of the libs and natives correctly configured so they could get programming immediately.
